# NetCDF with R Example

I am very excited to be writing this: the script in this repo is the accompanying resource for my very first article published in Towards Data Science!!! * *celebration noises* *

If you want a more in-depth tutorial than the comments [in the R script](https://github.com/BraeuNerd/ncdfwithRexample/blob/main/ncdfwithRexample.R), you can [read the article in TDS here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-crack-open-netcdf-files-in-r-and-extract-data-as-time-series-24107b70dcd)
